<h2>Breadth First Search (BFS):</h2> 

<p>
Run a breadth first search on a directed graph starting at a specified
source vertex and return a bfs-tree.  Duplicate input edges are
allowed.  The input is in adjacency array format with an ordering
among the outgoing edges.  If the graph is not connected then only the
tree over the vertices reachable from the source should be returned.
<p>

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
The input is a graph in the in the <a
href="benchmarks/graphIO.html">adjacency graph</a> format.  The graph
can be directed but the search will always start at vertex 0 as the
source and only search what is reachable from there.  The output is a
also a graph in the adjacency list format with each vertex only
including edges to its children in the BFS-tree.
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

Each distribution should be run for <tt>n=10,000,000</tt>.  The weights
used for average time are given in parentheses.
<ul>
<li>
(1) Random local graph with approximately 10 edges per vertex.  This
graph is generated so that the probability of each edge out of a
vertex is biased to nearby vertices.

<blockquote>
<tt>randLocalGraph -j -d 3 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) An RMAT graph with parameters (.3,.1,.1,.5) and about 5n edges.

<blockquote>
<tt>rMatGraph -j -a .5 -b .1 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) A 3 dimensional grid.
<blockquote>
<tt>gridGraph -j -d 3 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>
