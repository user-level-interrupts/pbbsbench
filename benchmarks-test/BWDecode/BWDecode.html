<h2>Burrows-Wheeler Decode (BWD):</h2> 

<p>
  This benchmark does an inverse Burrows-Wheeler transform.
  It takes a sequence of characters as input, which have been ordered by a
  Burrows-Wheeler transform.

  The specific Burrows-Wheeler transform we use is to sort each
  character in a string by the string that appears immediately after
  it.  To identify the front, the string is padded with a null
  character at the front (i.e.  when written and read from file should
  be read as a binary file).  As an example consider the string
  "abcabcab".  After padding (marked with $), we have the 
  characters with their following string:

  <pre>
    $ abcabcab
    a bcabcab
    b cabcab
    c abcab
    a bcab
    b cab
    c ab
    a b
    b 
  </pre>

  Now if we sort the characters by their string, we get
  <pre>
     b 
     c ab
     c abcab
     $ abcabcab  
     a b
     a bcab
     a bcabcab
     b cab
     b cabcab
  </pre>

  Hence we output "bcc$aaabb".  This string uniquely defines the
  original string which can be found using the inverse BW transform.
  Converting it back is the task of this benchmark.  The standard
  algorithm is to sort the characters which then links each character
  with its previous character.  This forms a linked list of length n,
  which needs to be followed.  Details can be found in descriptions of
  the BW transform.

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
  The input is a binary file containing exactly one null character
  corresponding to the start.  The output is a binary file not
  containing any null characters.  It will be one character shorter
  than the input (null character removed).  It must correspond to the
  original string that generated the input file by the algorithm
  described above.
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

We use three strings for the input:
<ul>
  <li>
    A string of length 250,000,000 characters generated by the trigram distribution.
<blockquote>
<tt>trigramString &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

  <li>
    <tt>etext99</tt>, which is a approximately 100 Million characters from the Project Gutenberg project.
    </li>
</li>

<li>
  <tt>wikipedia250M.txt</tt>, which is 250 Million characters taken from wikipedia
</li>

</ul>
