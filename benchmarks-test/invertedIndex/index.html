<h2>Inverted Index (II):</h2> 

<p>
  Generates an inverted index from a text file.  It assumes each
  document starts with a given "start string".  In this benchmark the
  start string is "&lt;doc" (as used in wikipedia entries).  The
  benchmark breaks the file into "documents" (strings) based on this
  document start string.  The start strings are dropped, and documents
  are given integer identifiers starting from 0 and in the order they
  appear in the file.
</p>

<p>
  For each document all upper case letters (A-Z) are converted to
  lowercase all lowercase letters are kept and all others are blacked
  out.  What remains is broken into words (i.e. contiguous sequences
  of letters).  We now build an "inverted index", where each entry
  consists of a word and all the documents it belongs in.  The entries
  are are sorted lexicographically by word, and the list of entries
  are sorted by document identifier.  The output is then a string
  containing one entry per line, starting with the word, and then the
  document identifiers (in ascii).
</p>

<p>
  For example, the input string "&lt;doc this is a+String &lt;doc and_a2 sTrIng" would generate
  the inverted index string:

  <pre>
    a 0 1
    and 1
    is 0
    this 0
    string 0 1
  </pre>

  The timing must include the full cost of from parsing the input string to generating the final output string.
</p>

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
  The input is an ascii string containing the documents.   The output is as described above.
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

The test distributions are two files taken from wikipedia.
<ul>
  <li>
    <tt>wikisamp.xml</tt> : these are just summaries of each entry and short documents
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>wikipedia250M.txt</tt> : these are full documents
  </li>

</ul>
